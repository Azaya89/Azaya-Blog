# Azaya Blog.

This is a simple blog app created with Django, with the front end designed using bootstrap4 on html.

The app is deployed on Heroku with the address https://azayablog.herokuapp.com/. You can register, login, publish topics and entries under the topics of interest.

There is definitely some improvements that can be done on the front-end part though. I welcome any and all contributions towards the improvement of the project.
